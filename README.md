# DohOnLua
This very simple script on lua turns your web server into dns over https.
There will be no instructions. Use this script as it is. if you want to modify
 it away - don't stop yourself. if you decide to send your changes back to me,
I will be very grateful. The only thing I will add: I use it with the lighttpd 
server on the openwrt router. 
And, requires a socket for lua
